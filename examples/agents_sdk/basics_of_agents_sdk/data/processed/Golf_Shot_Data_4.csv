This might be causing you to hit down too much on the ball, which can lead to more backspin and less distance. Additionally, the face angle is open relative to your swing path, which could be contributing to a rightward flight. Focus on making sure your clubface is square at impact and work on your follow-through for a smoother shot.",swing path drill,1.1913916,70.0,101.325,73

The club path is slightly out to the right (5.7 degrees), while the club face is left (about -3.2 degrees). This means you're adding some sidespin, which can cause your ball to curve left. Focus on getting your club face aligned more with your club path to reduce side spin. Also, your high backspin (over 6,000 rpm) is great for stopping the ball on the green, but be mindful of your launch angle, which can sometimes make it harder to achieve distance.
