The slightly negative attack angle suggests you're hitting down on the ball more than you should, which can lead to inconsistent contact. The club face being slightly closed to your path may also cause the ball to curve left. Focus on ensuring the face is more square to the target at impact. Try to have a more neutral attack angle for better distance and control.",swing path drill,1.1913916,70.0,101.325,73
