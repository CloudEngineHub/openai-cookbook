The good club speed shows you're generating decent power. However, the attack angle is slightly negative, which could lead to chunky contacts. Aim for a slightly steeper angle as you hit down more on the ball. The face angle suggests the club is open at impact, leading to some right spin. Focus on squaring the face to improve accuracy and reduce sidespin. A higher launch angle is good for your wedge shots, keeping the ball in the air longer for softer landings. Consider practicing to ensure consistent contact and square your clubface at impact.",face angle drill,1.196976,68.0,101.325,68
