To improve, focus on bringing your club on a straighter path and aim to keep the clubface square to that path as you strike the ball. This will help you gain better control and accuracy over your shots.",swing path drill,1.1903353,69.998,101.33,83

Your club path is aimed a bit to the right, which might cause the ball to slice.

This is causing a high backspin rate and can affect distance. Aim to flatten your swing a bit and keep your clubface more square at impact to control the ball better.
