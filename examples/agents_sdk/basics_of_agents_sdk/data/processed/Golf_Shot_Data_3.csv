The big takeaway is that your club path (3.09°) is good, meaning you're swinging slightly from inside to out, but the face is quite open (9.03°). This causes your ball to start right and curve left. You also have a high backspin rate (2889 rpm), which suggests you might be hitting the ball a bit too steep with your 7-iron, impacting distance.

This is leading to less distance and curve on your shots. Plus, your attack angle is a bit steep, which isn't ideal for wedge play. Focus on squaring your face to the path and aligning your swing to encourage a straighter ball flight.",swing path drill,1.1903353,69.998,101.33,83

Focus on keeping your body aligned properly during your swing. A slight adjustment in your setup could help improve accuracy.
