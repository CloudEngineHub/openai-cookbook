The club speed is good for a sand wedge, but your attack angle is slightly negative, indicating you might be hitting down too much. This can cause excessive backspin and height. The club path is reasonably good, but the face angle suggests you're hitting slightly to the right. Focus on making sure your clubface is square to your path at impact. Also, your carry distance is around 64 yards, which is decent, but aim for a more consistent ball flight with less total deviation in distance. Try to center your strike on the clubface for better control.",clubface alignment drill,1.1954004,68.0,101.325,83
