The club speed is nice, but with a negative attack angle (-7.6 degrees), you're hitting down too steeply. This can lead to unwanted spin and loss of distance. Focus on making a smoother swing with a more neutral attack angle to help the ball lift better. Your spin rates are high, which may indicate that the ball is digging into the ground instead of gliding through the grass. Additionally, consider aligning your clubface more with your swing path, which is slightly out of sync. A more consistent swing will definitely help you find better carry distance.
